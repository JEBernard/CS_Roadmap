   My name is Jason Bernard. I am a data coordinator for Covance Laboratories in Madison Wisconsin. I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science from IPFW. 
My father first taught me how to program when I was young and I have been hooked ever since. I look forward to learning as much as I can about the profession. I plan on taking either a Software Engineer or Bioinformatics concentration. 

<p> My favorite books are: 
<br>
 Lord of the Rings
<br>
  The Dark Tower Series
<br>
 Jack Ryan Series
